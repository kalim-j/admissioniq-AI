import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

async function scrapeNIRFColleges() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Scrape NIRF rankings
  await page.goto('https://www.nirfindia.org/Rankings/2025/EngineeringRankingALL.html');
  
  // Extract college data
  const colleges = await page.evaluate(() => {
    // Extract logic here
  });
  
  await browser.close();
  return colleges;
}
```
