// Note: Firebase Client SDK doesn't work directly in Middleware easily without admin SDK or session cookies.
// However, we can do a basic check for a 'session' cookie if we set one, or handle it on the client side in layouts.
// Since the user asked for "protect /dashboard /interview /history /profile with middleware", 
// and using Firebase Client SDK, the standard way is client-side protection or using Firebase Auth session cookies.
// For simplicity and adherence to the prompt (client SDK), I'll implement a client-side layout protector,
// but I'll add a placeholder middleware that redirects if a basic auth token isn't present if the user sets it.

  // We'll rely on client-side protection for this specific implementation
  // as per the "use Firebase client SDK (not admin) in browser" requirement.
